# Wick

Wick is a multipurpose creation environment that allows anyone to build a wide range of easily sharable internet games, animations and interactive doohickies for both phones and desktops - all in the browser.

Wick allows easier access to new web technologies through a visual editor, a timeline system, and a scripting system that makes learning and writing javascript easier. Wick also exports projects as standalone webpages or embeddable HTML5 canvases - no external players or runtimes necessary!

### How to run the editor/player locally for development
* Clone or download and unzip this repo
* Open terminal in the newly made `wick` folder and run a python webserver using: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* Open a browser window, and go to `http://localhost:8000/`
