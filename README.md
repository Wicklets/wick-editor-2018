# Wick

![Wick editor screenshot](resources/editor.png)

Wick is an HTML5-based editor and player for games, animations, and other interactive media on the web.

Wick allows easier access to new web technologies through a visual editor, a timeline system, and a scripting system that makes learning and writing javascript easier. Wick also exports projects as single webpages that can be run standalone or embedded on other websites.

Try the editor [here](http://wickeditor.com/)!

### How to run the editor locally for development
* Clone or download and unzip this repo
* Open terminal in the newly made `wick` folder and start an HTTP server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* Open a browser window, and go to `http://localhost:8000/`
