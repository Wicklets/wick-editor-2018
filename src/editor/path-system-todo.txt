PATH SYSTEM TODO FINAL ALMOST DONE ACTUALLY

// Core

  -  Undo/Redo

  X  Subtract with eraser paths
  X  Split apart paths with multiple pieces
  X  Fill requested holes

// GUI

  -  Tool options interface
    >  Paintbrush/fill color
    >  Brush width
  -  Toggle potrace smoothing / potrace smoothing amount
  -  Fill color in path properties

// Current bugs

  -  Loop union bug
  -  'callback is not a funciton' in potrace after quickly drawing many paths
  -  Paths inside paths not counting as intersecting
  -  Werid flickering that happens sometimes
  -  Pixi.js blurry fullscreen stretching
  -  Split paths with shapes causes weirdness sometimes
  -  Split paths for a second time causes invert weirdness

// Fancy

  -  Import SVG Files
  -  Line tool
  -  Path bend mode
  -  Selection box cuts paths
  -  Selected paths should be highlighted somehow (like flash) (maybe everything should be?)
