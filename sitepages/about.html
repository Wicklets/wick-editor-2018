	<h1>About</h1>

	<h2>What's Wick?</h2>
	<div class="blurb">The Wick Editor is a free online tool that facilitates the production of web-based, multimedia projects. Wick aims to make web technologies more accessible, letting individuals create everything from basic animations to complex video games. </div>

	<h2>Why Wick?</h2>
	<div class="blurb">Wick was created to allow individuals of any age, background, or technical ability to easily create content for the web. The creators of the Wick Editor have been fans and contributors of freely shared online libraries for years. By giving students, learners and curious creators a simple way to get started, we hope to enrich the ecosystem of the web while helping people develop the skills to create and share whatever they want. </div>

	<h2>Who Are We?</h2>

	<a href=https://twitter.com/jrispolo target="_blank">Josh Rispoli</a> joined shortly after to help bring Wick online.
