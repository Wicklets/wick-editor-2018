	<h2>What's Wick?</h2>

	<h2>Why Wick?</h2>
	<div class="blurb">Wick was created to allow individuals of any age, background, or technical ability to easily create content for the web. The creators of the Wick Editor have been fans and contributors of freely shared online libraries for years. By giving students, learners and newcomers to the "craft of creating" a simple way to get started, we hope to enrich the ecosystem of the web while helping people develop the skills to create and share whatever they want. </div>

	<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
	<div class="blurb">The Wick Editor was created by <a href=https://twitter.com/zrispo target="_blank">Zach Rispoli</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/lucapodular target="_blank">Luca Damasco</a> during the Spring of 2016. As students, Zach and Luca have been studying the intersection between Fine Art and High Tech through the Computer Science and Art programs at Carnegie Mellon University. Josh Rispoli has also joined in to help bring Wick online.</div>
